# Physics-Based Object Interaction (Unity)

## Overview
Explore physics-based object interactions in Unity using components like Colliders, Rigidbodies, Joints, Particle Systems, and Cloth. Drive a controllable ball through a simple scene and observe how different physics components respond.

## How to Play
1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Load the main scene.
3. Press Play.

### Controls
- Move: WASD or Arrow keys

## Components Used
- Collider: Detects collisions between objects.
- Rigidbody: Enables physics simulation (mass, drag, gravity).
- Fixed Joint: Rigidly connects two objects.
- Spring Joint: Creates elastic connections between objects.
- Hinge Joint: Allows rotation around a pivot.
- Particle System: Plays effects.
- Cloth: Simulates realistic cloth movement.

Note: Some components (e.g., Particle System, Joints) react automatically when the ball collides with objects.
